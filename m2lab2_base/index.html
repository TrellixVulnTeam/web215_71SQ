    <h2>Assignment Instructions</h2>
    <pre>
      Question 1: Mozilla Thimble
      Go to https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/ and remix "Homework Excuse Generator".
      (You can find the project directly at https://thimbleprojects.org/mozillalearning/11698/ also.)
      This is a simple warmup. Make a few changes to each array (add, delete, or change items).
      Then add a new list called until and add some times in the future (example: "next Thursday").
      Finally, modify the generator so it says things like:
      "My dog ate my homework, but I'll have it next Thursday"

      To submit: publish your remixed project, this will give you a URL containing your username.
      Add that as a JavaScript comment like this in your m2lab.js:
      // Question 1: http://blahblahblah


      Question 2: 99 bottles of beer on the wall
      finish the function singBottleSong(amount, drink) in m2lab.js.
      you can test it by running the function q2_test() function.


      Question 3: Another beverage song
      finish the function singBottleSong2(song), which takes a Song object.
      (The constructor function is provided). This generalizes the song so that
      it can be sung about things other than bottles and walls.


      Question 4: Password Checker
      finish the function isPasswordValid(pw), which takes a string password and returns
      true or false depending on whether or not the password matches.
      use the String function search() and regular expressions to make this work.
      See W3Schools 'String methods' and 'regular expressions' for details,
      as well as the edx course PennX SD4x.

      Question 5: Password Strength Tester
      (this question relates to M2HW, question 1)
      finish the function checkPasswordStrength(pw), which takes a string password
      and returns a string, 'weak', 'medium' or 'strong'.
      a password is medium if it contains a number or punctuation (counting '.,!?')
      a password is strong if it contains both
      otherwise, a password is weak
      use the String function search() and regular expressions to make this work.
      See W3Schools 'String methods' and 'regular expressions' for details,
      as well as the edx course PennX SD4x.
